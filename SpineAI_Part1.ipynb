    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a chronic disease that causes progressive non-traumatic compression of the cervical spinal cord. The following image shows an a schematic representation of the constellation of anatomic changes that occur in DCM that lead to compression of the cervical spinal cord. \n",
    "\n",
    "![image1](images/image1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "As the compression of the spinal cord worsens DCM can cause neurologic deficits, impaired mobility, and significant impairment in quality of life. The CSM-International and CSM-North America clinical trials are the two largest clinical trials that studied patients with DCM. The two studies together included 757 patients with DCM. Every patient had an MRI scan of the cervical spine and then went on to have surgery. The patients were then assessed 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months following surgery. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### This dataset contained a sufficient number of MRIs to train a deep learning model to recognize signs of DCM. "

    "## Data Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Each patient had a pre-operative MRI of the cervical spine that at a minimum included a T2-weighted and T1-weighted sequence with axial and saggital series. Unfortunately the MRIs were stored in various formats. The majority were dicom files, but many were stored as a tiled series of jpegs or pngs. In addition some MRIs were missing or corrupted. \n",
    "\n",
    "Table 1 - Summary of MRI parameters extracted from dicom files across the study population. \n",
    "\n",
    "| Parameter       | Range          | Median    |\n",
    "|-----------------|----------------|-----------|\n",
    "| Slice Thickness | 2.5 - 6mm      | 4mm       |\n",
    "| Image width     | 256-512 px     | 512 px    |\n",
    "| Image height    | 256-512 px     | 512 px    |\n",
    "| Series Length   | 16 - 83 images | 62 images |\n",
    "\n",
    "To maintain consistency we used only the MRIs that were stored in dicom format. We chose to focus on the T2-weighted axial sequence. Each axial sequence contained approximately 60 slices that spanned from the foramen magnum to the upper thoracic spine. We extracted the T2-weighted axial sequence for each patient and stored it as a new dicom file. This was accomplished manually using OsiriX Lite. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example series of axial images from a single patient tiled in a single image. \n",
    "![image3](images/image3.jpg)\n",
    "The set of images presented to the deep learning model included each T2-weighted axial image from each patient. Thus each image was represented independently. The information relating to which patient each image originated from and the ordering of the images was lost. This was an intentional comprimise. The spinal cord and canal looks fairly similar regardless of which level of the spinal cord the image originated from. We felt the deep learning model would be able to generalize features from this data representation. Representing our data this way allowed us to have many more images for model training. "

    "## Data Labelling\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of pathalogic changes that can be identified in an MRI scan of a patient with DCM. The full range of imaging findings are summarized in this 2016 article from Neurosurgical Focus. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27246488) \n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, the structural changes related to DCM that can be detected on MRI include:\n",
    "* Spinal cord compression\n",
    "* Cervical Stenosis\n",
    "* Cord signal change\n",
    "* Ligamentous Pathology\n",
    "* Spondylolysthesis\n",
    "* Sagittal Alignment \n",
    "\n",
    "We chose to focus our deep learning model on detecting spinal cord compression for the following reasons:\n",
    "* Spinal cord compression is highly sensive for myelopathy. The following 2010 study of 103 patients (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20150835) found that spinal cord compression was 100% sensitive and 79.6% specific for clinical myelopathy. \n",
    "* Spinal cord compression can be reliably graded on T2-weighted axial images using a number of grading systems. The inter-rater reliability of these grading systems is greater than 80% and in some studies was over 95%. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27246488)\n",
    "* Even though spinal cord compression is not 100% specific for clinical myelopathy the presence of spinal cord compression is a concerning finding that warrents continued follow up. \n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons we believed that a deep learning model capable of reliably detecting spinal cord compression would serve as a useful screening tool for detecting patients that had symptoms of clinical myelopathy or were at risk of developing clinical myelopathy. \n",
    "\n",
    "To standardize the data labelling we used the qualitative criteria outlined in this 2010 study. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20150835. Importantly we did not differentiate between Partial spinal cord compression and circumfrential spinal cord compression. Instead we defined spinal cord compression as any indentation on the spinal cord parenchyma which changed the contour of the spinal cord perimeter. Labelers assessed each T2-weighted axial slice and assigned a label of:\n",
    "* 1: evidence of partial or circumfrential spinal cord compression or \n",
    "* 0: no spinal cord compression. \n",
